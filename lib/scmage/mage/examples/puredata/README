LINUX

1. This has been tested on linux only for now, maybe it could work on OSX with appropriate suffix change ?
2. make sure that libmage.so, libmage-htsengine.so and libmage-sptk.so are in pd path ('ln -s' them in /usr/local/lib for instance) or in the same folder as mage~.pd_linux (normally ./bin/Release or ./bin/Debug)
3. make sure that the "data" folder is filled (cf. ./data/README), or modify mage.pd appropriately for path to voices/*.conf and label files, as well as all associated files (models, trees, labels, ...)
4. create a folder in ./examples/puredata
	cd examples/puredata
	mkdir mage
(just an example, you can name it as you want)
5. run:
	cd mage
	pd -path ../../../bin/Release ../mage.pd
